/**
 * The one place that owns the service worker, and the only place that asks it for a newer
 * version of the app.
 *
 * <p>The worker is registered with `registerType: 'prompt'`, which parks a new version rather
 * than swapping it in under somebody mid-message. Sandesh started on 'autoUpdate' and the note
 * in the vite config said what that traded: a build activating on its own reloads the page,
 * and the draft in the composer is React state, not Dexie — it does not survive. The held
 * event stream goes with it. So the app now asks, the way Nirman does.</p>
 *
 * <p>Parking is only half of it: <em>somebody has to look</em>. A browser checks for a new
 * worker on a navigation, and an installed PWA on a site phone does not navigate — it is
 * opened in the morning, kept in the task switcher all day, and reopened the next morning onto
 * the same screen. A version published on Tuesday could sit unnoticed for a fortnight. So the
 * app asks by itself on three triggers — the timer, the foreground and `online`, because none
 * of the three alone catches a phone that started up already claiming to have signal — and a
 * person can ask from Settings, which turns "I think mine is out of date" from a telephone
 * call to the office into a button.</p>
 *
 * <p>One registration, held here, rather than a `useRegisterSW` per component that wants it:
 * two calls are two Workbox instances racing to register the same script, and the offer would
 * then be answered by whichever of them heard about it.</p>
